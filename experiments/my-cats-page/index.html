        <p class="about">
          Meet Moony, the oldest. He's the sweetest cat ever known to mankind, but also the most skittish you'll ever meet. He likes to wake me up by nibbling my nose and sometimes stares at me as if he's looking deep into my soul.

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p class="history">
        This little guy showed up in a parking lot and stayed there for days. I called the firefighters to try and get him, but they only scared him away (the funny part is that there were five of them). However, he came back the other day and I slowly gained his trust with food.

        <h3>About</h3>
        <p class="about">
          This is "Feinho", the youngest one. She's independent, fierce, and loves to jump around. Her meowing is certainly unique. She also looks like sadness consumes her soul, but is actually very happy and spoiled.

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p class="history">
          When my mother's cat's kittens were born, she used to take pictures of each one and send texts introducing them. There were the orange twins, the white one, the black one, and the "feinho" one, which means "little ugly" in portuguese. The name stuck and now she's my pretty girl.
