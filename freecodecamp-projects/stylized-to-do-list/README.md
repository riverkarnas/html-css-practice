# Stylized To-Do List
This was part of freeCodeCamp's Basic CSS section in the Responsive Web Design Certification

## Purpose
To practice CSS layouts 

## What I practiced
- Radial-gradient background
- Unordered List with sublist
- Pseudo-classes
- Padding, margin, and border
- Border-radius
- Checkboxes
- Background accessibility

## Status
Practice project - completed

## Notes
- The h1 text color passes WCAG AA contrast requirements against dominant background color, but fails WCAG AAA's stricter requirements in some gradient areas
