# Design a Business Card
 This was part of freeCodeCamp's Basic CSS section in the Responsive Web Design Certification

## Purpose

- Basic HTML structure and class styling

## Status

## Notes
 Some visual elements (image, background colors, hr styling, and fonts) were intentionally modified from the original freeCodeCamp instructions.
 The anchor element was also updated to include a 'target' attribure.
